This advanced version of the original Keylogger Defender now includes real-time monitoring, malware signature detection, desktop notifications, and log exports to JSON/CSV.

## Features

- ✅ Real-time file system monitoring using `watchdog`
- ✅ Desktop notifications for live alerts (`plyer`)
- ✅ Malware signature matching by SHA256 hash
- ✅ Log export to `.json` and `.csv`
- ✅ Monitors use of known keylogger libraries (`pynput`, `keyboard`, `pyperclip`)

## Setup

1. Clone or download the repo
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run it:

```bash
python keylogger_defender.py
```

## Output

- Alerts shown in real-time via desktop notification
- Logs written to:
  - `logs/detection_log.txt`
  - `logs/detection_log.json`
  - `logs/detection_log.csv`

## Future Ideas

- Build a GUI dashboard
- Integrate with a basic local SIEM system
- Include external YARA rule support
